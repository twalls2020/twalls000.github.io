      <h2 class="border-top">About Tanasha</h2>
        <p>After graduating college, I attended a workforce development program called Year Up. There, I studied Hardware IT and was granted a Internship with USA Today | Gannett Co after 6 months. I then  converted into a full time Software QA Engineer at Gannett Co. I am 26 years of age with alot drive and experience. I love working with people and bouncing ideas off of a team. Therefore, I decided to take on the Thinkful Bootcamp Engineering Imeersion Course. I am eager to see what's next for me! </p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!

        <p>.</p>
